The `sen5x` sensor platform allows you to use Sensirion
[SEN5X Series](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SEK-SEN5x) and
[SEN6X Series](https://sensirion.com/sen6x-air-quality-sensor-platform)
Environmental sensors with ESPHome.

The [I²C Bus](/components/i2c) is required in your configuration for this sensor to work.
This sensor supports both UART and I²C communication. Only I²C communication is implemented in this component.

  | Middle                 |   100   |   300   |   50   |   20   |
  | Strong (Air Purifier)  |   250   |   300   |  150   |   20   |

  For more information see
  [SEN6x – Temperature Acceleration and Compensation Instructions](https://sensirion.com/media/documents/C964FCC8/693FD554/PS_AN_SEN6x_Temperature_Compensation_and_Acceleration_Application_No.pdf).

  - **k** (*Optional*): Filter constant K.
  - **p** (*Optional*): Filter constant P.
  - **t1** (*Optional*): Time constant T1 in seconds.
  - **t2** (*Optional*): Time constant T2 in seconds.

- **acceleration_mode** (*Optional*): Allowed value are `low`, `medium` and `high`. Defaults to `low`.
  Only available with SEN54 or SEN55.

  By default, the RH/T acceleration algorithm is optimized for a sensor which is positioned in free air.
  If the sensor is integrated into another device, the ambient RH/T output values might not be optimal
  due to different thermal behavior.

  This parameter can be used to adapt the RH/T acceleration behavior for the actual use-case, leading in an
  improvement of the ambient RH/T output accuracy. There is a limited set of different modes available.
  Medium and high accelerations are particularly indicated for air quality monitors which are subjected to
  large temperature changes. Low acceleration is advised for stationary devices not subject to large
  variations in temperature.

- **address** (*Optional*, int): Manually specify the I²C address of the sensor.
  Defaults to `0x69` for the SEN5X sensors or `0x6B` for the SEN6X sensors.

## Wiring

The both sensor series use a JST GHR-06V-S 6 pin type connector, with a 1.25mm pitch. The cable needs this
connector:

{{< img src="jst6pin.png" alt="Image" width="50.0%" class="align-center" >}}

The SEN5X series operates at 5V and must have pin no.5 shorted to GND. This forces the sensor into I²C mode.
I²C is the only mode supported by this component.

The SEN5X series operates at 3.3V and only supports I²C mode.

For better stability, the SDA and SCL lines require suitable pull-up resistors.

## Automatic Cleaning

The SEN5X sensors have an automatic fan-cleaning which will accelerate the built-in fan to maximum speed for
10 seconds in order to blow out the dust accumulated inside the fan. The default automatic-cleaning interval
is 168 hours (1 week) of uninterrupted use. Switching off the sensor resets this time counter. When the module
is in Measurement-Mode an automatic fan-cleaning procedure will be triggered periodically following a defined
cleaning interval. This will accelerate the fan to maximum speed for 10 seconds to blow out the accumulated
dust inside the fan.

- Measurement values are not updated while the fan-cleaning is running.
- The cleaning interval is set to 604,800 seconds (i.e., 168 hours or 1 week).
- The interval can be configured using the Set Automatic Cleaning Interval command.
- Set the interval to 0 to disable the automatic cleaning.
- A sensor reset, resets the cleaning interval to its default value
- If the sensor is switched off, the time counter is reset to 0. Make sure to trigger a cleaning cycle at least
  every week if the sensor is switched off and on periodically (e.g., once per day).
- The cleaning procedure can also be started manually with the `start_autoclean_fan` Action.

SEN6X sensors supports fan cleaning but not the automatic fan cleaning interval.

### `start_fan_autoclean` Action

This [action](/automations/actions#all-actions) manually starts fan-cleaning.

``` yaml
on_...:
  then:
    - sen5x.start_fan_autoclean: my_sen55
```

You can emulate the SEN5X automatic fan cleaning interval on the SEN6X sensors by using the `interval` component to
perform this action periodically. For example, to clean the fan every 7 days while the device is on, as
recommended by the manufacturer, the following configuration can be added:

``` yaml
interval:
  - interval: 7d
    then:
      - sen5x.start_fan_autoclean: my_sen66
```

## Humidity Sensor Heater

The SEN6X humidity sensor can develop an offset in the humidity reading when exposed to high levels of humidity
for extended periods of time. It supports a heater similar to the one in the SHT4X. The difference is no
automatic mode. Instead you have to trigger `sen5x.activate_heater` action occasionally.

### `activate_heater` Action

This [action](/automations/actions#all-actions) manually starts the heater. First all measurements are stopped,
then the heater is turned on at 200mW for 1s, finally there is a 20 second delay to before reenabling the
measurements. This is to ensure the heating effects are gone before temperature measurements resume.

``` yaml
on_...:
  then:
    - sen5x.activate_heater: my_sen66
```

## CO₂ Calibration and Compensation

The CO₂ sensor by default has auto-calibration enabled. Auto-calibration will adjust the minimum measurement over
the last week or so to the outdoor average of slightly more than 400 ppm. Auto-calibration assumes that you are
opening the windows at least once a week. If you don't open the windows then over time the CO₂ level will tend
downward.

If you know your minimums are not going to be 400 ppm then you can disable auto-calibration, occasionally
take the sensor outside for 5 minutes and then force a manual CO₂ calibration.

### `perform_forced_co2_calibration` Action

This [action](/automations/actions#all-actions) forces a manual calibration on the CO₂ sensor.

``` yaml
number:
  - platform: template
    id: co2_forced_cal_value
    name: "CO2 Calibration Value"
    device_class: carbon_dioxide
    entity_category: CONFIG
    optimistic: true
    max_value: 1200
    min_value: 400
    step: 1
    initial_value: 420
    set_action:
      - delay: 1s
button:
  - platform: template
    name: "CO2 Calibrate"
    entity_category: CONFIG
    on_press:
      - sen5x.perform_forced_co2_calibration:
          value: !lambda |-
            float value = id(co2_forced_cal_value).state;
            return value;
          id: sen66_sensor
```

The CO₂ sensor also supports pressure compensation. You can either add `ambient_pressure_compensation_source`
to your configuration and the CO₂ will retrieve an updated pressure just before a CO₂ update. Or you can
occasionally call the `sen5x.set_ambient_pressure_compensation` action.

### `set_ambient_pressure_compensation` Action

This [action](/automations/actions#all-actions) updates the current pressure used in CO₂ pressure compensation. Must be in hPa or mbar.

``` yaml
sensor:
  - platform: copy
    id: pressure_to_sen6x
    source_id: pressure
    unit_of_measurement: hPa
    filters:
      - lambda: |-
          // convert Pa to hPa (or mBar)
          return x / 100.0;
    on_value:
      then:
        - lambda: !lambda |-
            id(sen66_sensor)->set_ambient_pressure_compensation(x);
```

Altitude based compensation is also available when you set the `altitude_compensation` configuration variable
to your correct elevation in meters. Note:

> [!NOTE]
> `altitude_compensation` and `ambient_pressure_compensation_source`are mutually exclusive. If you plan on using
the `sen5x.set_ambient_pressure_compensation` action do not set either `altitude_compensation` or
`ambient_pressure_compensation_source` in your configuration.

## NOx and VOC Algorithm Tuning

Both the NOx and VOC sensor support algorithm tuning. These variables are set with the `algorithm_tuning`
configuration under the `voc` and `nox` sensors. For more details see
[Engineering Guidelines for SEN5X](https://sensirion.com/media/documents/25AB572C/62B463AA/Sensirion_Engineering_Guidelines_SEN5x.pdf)

## Temperature Compensation

The SEN54, SEN55, SEN62, SEN63C, SEN65, SEN66, SEN68 or SEN69C contain and internal temperature compensation mechanism.
The compensated ambient temperature is calculated as follows:

``` c++
T_Ambient_Compensated = T_Ambient + (slope*T_Ambient) + offset
```

Where slope and offset are the values set with `temperature_compensation` configuration variables, smoothed with the
specified time constant, also a `temperature_compensation` configuration variable. The time constant is how fast the
slope and offset are applied. After the specified value in seconds, 63% of the new slope and offset are applied.

The STAR (Sensirion Temperature Acceleration Routine) engine set with `acceleration_mode` configuration variable
changes the responsiveness of both the temperature and humidity sensors.

More details about the tuning of these parameters for SEN5X sensors are included in the application note:
[Temperature Acceleration and Compensation Instructions for SEN5x](https://sensirion.com/media/documents/9B9DE2A7/61E957EB/Sensirion_Temperature_Acceleration_and_Compensation_Instructions_SEN.pdf).

The SEN62, SEN63C, SEN65, SEN66, SEN68 or SEN69C support temperature compensation using the same formula above but with the added
feature of up to five slots. These five slots contribute additively to temperature compensation and allow the user to compensate
for devices that can be turned on/off like a WiFi module or a cooling fan.

More details about the tuning of these parameters for SEN6X sensors are included in the application note:
[SEN6x – Temperature Acceleration and Compensation Instructions](https://sensirion.com/media/documents/C964FCC8/693FD554/PS_AN_SEN6x_Temperature_Compensation_and_Acceleration_Application_No.pdf).
