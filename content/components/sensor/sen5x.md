The `sen5x` sensor platform allows you to use your Sensirion [SEN50](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SEN50/), [SEN54](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SEN54/) and [SEN55](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SEN55/) Environmental sensor ([datasheet](https://sensirion.com/media/documents/6791EFA0/62A1F68F/Sensirion_Datasheet_Environmental_Node_SEN5x.pdf)) sensors with ESPHome.
The [I²C Bus](#i2c) is required to be set up in your configuration for this sensor to work.
This sensor supports both UART and I²C communication. Only I²C communication is implemented in this component.

  By default, the RH/T acceleration algorithm is optimized for a sensor which is positioned in free air.
  If the sensor is integrated into another device, the ambient RH/T output values might not be optimal
  due to different thermal behavior.

  This parameter can be used to adapt the RH/T acceleration behavior for the actual use-case, leading in an
  improvement of the ambient RH/T output accuracy. There is a limited set of different modes available.
  Medium and high accelerations are particularly indicated for air quality monitors which are subjected to
  large temperature changes. Low acceleration is advised for stationary devices not subject to large
  variations in temperature.

  For more information see
  [Temperature Acceleration and Compensation Instructions for SEN5x.](https://sensirion.com/media/documents/9B9DE2A7/61E957EB/Sensirion_Temperature_Acceleration_and_Compensation_Instructions_SEN.pdf)

- **address** (*Optional*, int): Manually specify the I²C address of the sensor. Defaults to `0x69` for
  SEN5X sensors and `0x6B` for SEN6X sensors.

> [!NOTE]

## Wiring

The sensor has a JST GHR-06V-S 6 pin type connector, with a 1.25mm pitch. The cable needs this connector:

{{< img src="jst6pin.png" alt="Image" width="50.0%" class="align-center" >}}

To force the sensor into I²C mode, the SEL pin (Interface Select pin no.5) must be shorted to ground (pin no.2). Pin 6 is not used.

For better stability, the SDA and SCL lines require suitable pull-up resistors.

## Automatic Fan Cleaning

The SEN5X sensors have an automatic fan-cleaning procedure will be triggered periodically following
`auto_cleaning_interval` cleaning interval. This will accelerate the fan to maximum speed for 10 seconds to blow
out the accumulated dust inside the fan.

- Measurement values are not updated while the fan-cleaning is running.
- The default cleaning interval is set to 604,800 seconds (i.e., 168 hours or 1 week).
- The interval can be configured using the Set Automatic Cleaning Interval command.
- Set the interval to 0 to disable the automatic cleaning.
- The cleaning procedure can also be started manually with the `start_fan_autoclean` Action.

## Actions

## Fan Cleaning

Both sensor families support manual running of the fan cleaning cycle by using the `sen5x.start_fan_autoclean` action.
Only available with the SEN54, SEN55, SEN62, SEN63C, SEN65, SEN66, SEN68 or SEN69C.

{{< anchor "start_fan_autoclean_action" >}}

## `sen5x.start_fan_autoclean` Action

This [action](/automations/actions#all-actions) manually starts fan cleaning.

```yaml
on_...:
  then:
    - sen5x.start_fan_autoclean: sen54
```

You can emulate the SEN5X automatic fan cleaning on a SEN6X sensor by calling the `sen5x.start_fan_autoclean:`
action periodically.

For example, to clean the fan every 7 days while the device is on, as recommended by the manufacturer, the
following configuration can be added:

``` yaml
interval:
  - interval: 7d
    then:
      - sen5x.start_fan_autoclean: my_sen66
```

## Humidity Sensor Heater

The SEN6X humidity sensor can develop an offset in the humidity reading when exposed to high levels of humidity
for extended periods of time. It supports a heater similar to the one in the SHT4X. The difference is no
automatic mode. Instead you have to trigger `sen5x.activate_heater` action occasionally.

{{< anchor "activate_heater_action" >}}

### `activate_heater` Action

This [action](/automations/actions#all-actions) manually starts the heater. First all measurements are stopped,
then the heater is turned on at 200mW for 1s, finally there is a 20 second delay to before reenabling the
measurements. This is to ensure the heating effects are gone before temperature measurements resume.

``` yaml
on_...:
  then:
    - sen5x.activate_heater: my_sen66
```

## CO₂ Calibration

The CO₂ sensor by default has auto-calibration enabled. Auto-calibration will adjust the minimum measurement over
the last week or so to the outdoor average of slightly more than 400 ppm. Auto-calibration assumes that you are
opening the windows at least once a week. If you don't open the windows then over time the CO₂ level will tend
downward.

If you know your minimums are not going to be 400 ppm then you can disable auto-calibration and occasionally
take the sensor outside for 5 minutes and then force a manual CO₂ calibration to the expected outdoor CO₂ level.

{{< anchor "perform_forced_co2_recalibration_action" >}}

### `perform_forced_co2_recalibration` Action

This [action](/automations/actions#all-actions) forces a manual calibration on the CO₂ sensor. The example below
will recalibrate the CO₂ sensor when the "CO₂ Calibrate" button is pressed using the "CO₂ Calibration Value"
number's current value.

``` yaml
number:
  - platform: template
    id: co2_forced_cal_value
    name: "CO₂ Calibration Value"
    device_class: carbon_dioxide
    entity_category: CONFIG
    optimistic: true
    max_value: 1200
    min_value: 400
    step: 1
    initial_value: 420
button:
  - platform: template
    name: "CO₂ Calibrate"
    entity_category: CONFIG
    on_press:
      - sen5x.perform_forced_co2_recalibration:
          value: !lambda |-
            float value = id(co2_forced_cal_value).state;
            return value;
          id: sen66_sensor
sensor:
  - platform: sen5x
    type: SEN69C
    id: sen66_sensor
    co2:
      name: "CO₂"
      ambient_pressure_compensation_source: pressure_hpa
```

## CO₂ Compensation

The CO₂ sensor supports pressure/altitude compensation. This first approach is to statically define either
`altitude_compensation` or `ambient_pressure_compensation`. This will improve your CO₂ accuracy over uncompensated
accuracy. Or you can dynamically adjust pressure compensation by either adding a `ambient_pressure_compensation_source`
to your configuration for automatic updates or periodically calling `sen5x.set_ambient_pressure_compensation` action
with the current pressure. Dynamic pressure updates provide the best CO₂ accuracy.

### `set_ambient_pressure_compensation` Action

This [action](/automations/actions#all-actions) updates the current pressure used in CO₂ pressure compensation.
Must be in hPa or mBar. Only available with SEN63C, SEN66 or SEN69C.

``` yaml
sensor:
  - platform: bmp581
    id: bmp581_sensor
    pressure:
      id: pressure_hpa
      filters:
        - lambda: |-
            // convert Pa to hPa (or mBar)
            return x * 0.01;
    on_value:
      then:
        - lambda: !lambda |-
            id(pressure_hpa)->set_ambient_pressure_compensation(x);
```

### Dynamic example with a local sensor

Note: pressure must be hPA or mBar

``` yaml
sensor:
  - platform: bmp581
    id: bmp581_sensor
    pressure:
      id: pressure_hpa
      filters:
        - lambda: |-
            // convert Pa to hPa (or mBar)
            return x * 0.01;
  - platform: sen5x
    type: SEN69C
    co2:
      name: "CO₂"
      ambient_pressure_compensation_source: pressure_hpa
```

### Static example with altitude

``` yaml
sensor:
  - platform: sen5x
    type: SEN66
    co2:
      name: "CO₂"
      altitude_compensation: 427m
```

## NOx and VOC Algorithm Tuning

Both the NOx and VOC sensor support algorithm tuning. These variables are set with the `algorithm_tuning`
configuration under the `voc` and `nox` sensors. For more details see
[Engineering Guidelines for SEN5X](https://sensirion.com/media/documents/25AB572C/62B463AA/Sensirion_Engineering_Guidelines_SEN5x.pdf)

## Temperature Compensation

The SEN54, SEN55, SEN62, SEN63C, SEN65, SEN66, SEN68 or SEN69C contain an internal temperature compensation mechanism.
The compensated ambient temperature is calculated as follows:

``` c++
T_Ambient_Compensated = T_Ambient + (slope*T_Ambient) + offset
```

Where slope and offset are the values set with `temperature_compensation` configuration variables, smoothed with the
specified time constant, also a `temperature_compensation` configuration variable. The time constant is how fast the
slope and offset are applied. After the specified value in seconds, 63% of the new slope and offset are applied.

More details about the tuning of these parameters for SEN5X sensors are included in the application note:
[Temperature Acceleration and Compensation Instructions for SEN5x](https://sensirion.com/media/documents/9B9DE2A7/61E957EB/Sensirion_Temperature_Acceleration_and_Compensation_Instructions_SEN.pdf).

The SEN62, SEN63C, SEN65, SEN66, SEN68 or SEN69C support temperature compensation using the same formula above
but with the added feature of up to five slots. At this time only slot 0 is supported. A later update will correct
this issue.

More details about the tuning of these parameters for SEN6X sensors are included in the application note:
[SEN6x – Temperature Acceleration and Compensation Instructions](https://sensirion.com/media/documents/C964FCC8/693FD554/PS_AN_SEN6x_Temperature_Compensation_and_Acceleration_Application_No.pdf).
